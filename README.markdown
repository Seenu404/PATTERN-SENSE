# PATTERN-SENSE

PATTERN-SENSE is a machine learning project focused on pattern recognition and data analysis. It leverages advanced algorithms to identify and interpret patterns in datasets, suitable for applications in [e.g., image processing, time-series analysis, or classification tasks].

## Features
- Implements robust pattern recognition algorithms using [e.g., neural networks, clustering].
- Supports large datasets with Git LFS for efficient storage.
- Modular codebase for easy customization and scalability.
- Built with Python and popular ML libraries.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git
